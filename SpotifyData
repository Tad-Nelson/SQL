In this query, I am looking into spotfiy music data to answer the questions below. 

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata; 

--What is the average danceability by artist  

SELECT artist_name, ROUND(avg(danceability)* 100, 2) AS Danceability_Percent
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY Danceability_Percent desc; 

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?  

SELECT artist_name, avg(popularity) AS popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--What artist released the longest song?  

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms/1000 AS duration_sec
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_sec desc 
LIMIT 1;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?  

SELECT avg(danceability)*100 AS average_danceability
FROM 
(SELECT danceability
FROM SpotifyData
ORDER BY popularity Desc
LIMIT 10);

--What is the average tempo for the top 10 danceable songs? 

 SELECT avg(tempo)
 FROM 
     (SELECT tempo
     FROM SpotifyData
     ORDER BY danceability DESC
     LIMIT 10);
     
--Is there a correlation between tempo and popularity? 

-- Is there a correlation between the length of a song and its popularity, and if so, what is the strength and direction of this correlation?
