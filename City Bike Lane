In this query, I am looking at city bike lane data to help answer question about public safety for the city. 

-- Boss wants a list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher. She also wants to see the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane". 
    -- To make things clearer, could change 'average safety' to rating.

WITH safety_avg_CTE AS 
( SELECT street, avg(safetyrating) AS average_safety
FROM CityBikeLanes 
GROUP BY street
)

SELECT average_safety, street,'Safe Lane' AS tag
FROM safety_avg_CTE 
WHERE average_safety >=4.0 
ORDER BY average_safety desc;

--Boss asked for: a list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed".
    --Bike lanes with an average safety rating of 4 or more should be labeled "Leave As-Is".
    --Bike lanes with an average safety rating of less than 2.5 should be labeled as "Remove".
    --All other bike lanes should be labeled as "Improvements Needed" 
    
SELECT street, safetyrating,
    AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) AS "average_safety_rating",
CASE
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN "Leave As-Is" 
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN "Remove"
    ELSE "Improvements Needed"
    END AS "Recommendation" 
FROM CityBikeLanes;
