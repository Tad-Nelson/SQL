This database contains a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. I am querying to answer the questions below. 
--Show Customers who are not in the US. 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA'; 

-- What country has the most customers? 
SELECT Country, COUNT(Country) AS Customer_Quantity 
FROM customers
GROUP BY Country  
ORDER BY Customer_Quantity desc; 

--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
