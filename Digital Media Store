This database contains a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. I am querying to answer the questions below. 

--1. Show Customers who are not in the US. 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA'; 

--2. What country has the most customers? 
SELECT Country, COUNT(Country) AS Customer_Quantity 
FROM customers
GROUP BY Country  
ORDER BY Customer_Quantity desc; 

--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.BillingCountry, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM invoices
JOIN customers ON invoices.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID
ORDER BY invoices.BillingCountry;
 
--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents. 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title 
FROM employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%sales%'; 

--5. Find a list of billing countries from the Invoice table  
    --NTS: Inner Query was orginally missing the CustomerId which did not allow the outer query to have access/connect to the inner query. Name inner query.
 
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName,iv.BillingAddress, iv.BillingCity, iv.BillingCountry, iv.BillingPostalCode
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT iv.BillingAddress, iv.BillingCity, iv.BillingCountry, iv.BillingPostalCode, iv.CustomerId
        FROM invoices iv) iv
JOIN customers c ON iv.CustomerId = c.CustomerId;  

--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.     
SELECT e.FirstName,e.LastName, iv.InvoiceId
FROM invoices iv
JOIN customers c ON iv.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN employees e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;

--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers. 
SELECT c.FirstName Cust_FirstName, c.LastName Cust_LastName, c.Country, e.FirstName emp_FirstName, e.LastName emp_LastName, iv.total 
FROM invoices iv 
JOIN customers c ON iv.CustomerId = c.CustomerId 
JOIN employees e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;

--8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
